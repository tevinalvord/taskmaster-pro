# Taskmaster-Pro

## Purpose
A simple task tracking site where you can add a task and keep track of it in four columns, "TO DO", "IN PROGRESS", "IN REVIEW", "DONE". You can drag tasks between columns. Once you pick up a task, the backgrounds of the columns change color to help you know where to drag the task and where it will land. You can also drag the task to the bottom do delete a single task. There is also a delete all tasks button.
